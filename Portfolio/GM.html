          <p class="project-section-details">For three months, I interned at General Motors in their
            Quality Data and Strategy Development department. My main project entailed revamping
            a market research tool they frequently used. The tool ingested data from JD Power's annual
            APEAL survey so Project Managers could analyze scores and benchmark against competitors. Completing
            this project required exploring the current tool in MS Excel, designing a new version
            based on user feedback, and developing it in MS Access. This involved designing a relational database
            and writing complex SQL queries to power the interface. Unfortunately,
            I am not allowed to share photos or specifics about the interface because it handles
            confidential data. </p>

          <p class="project-section-title">Background Information</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">At the time of my internship, GM was going through a business
             deal to sell Opel, one of its subsidiary car companies. The market research
             tool was created by a third party and provided to Opel, which unfortunately meant GM would lose
             access to it once Opel was sold. I was tasked with developing a new version so
             GM could have an improved, in-house tool to analyze customer satisfaction data.</p>

          <p class="project-section-details">I worked independently on this project,
            but regularly met with a mentor to show progress and discuss roadblocks. Below you
            can see the process I went through to complete this project, ending with a final
            demonstration of my tool to GM leadership.</p>

          <p class="project-section-title">Challenges and Successes</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">Since I was the first and only intern in the
            department at the time, my role was not completely defined. Though this uncharted
            territory was daunting at first, I was able to pick a project tailored to my interests and
            also trailblaze a path for future interns. The independent nature of the work challenged me
            to identify and solve many issues on my own, which was especially difficult since I was working
            with unfamiliar tools and learning a new language (VBA). This forced me to learn at a rapid
            pace, but resulted in a product I could proudly call my own.</p>

          <p class="project-section-details">This was my first time experiencing the stresses and
            opportunities of working at a large company. I struggled and made mistakes, but
            the challenges helped me to grow both intellectually and professionally. Seeing how happy my
            redesigned tool made GM employees was the most rewarding part of the experience.</p>
