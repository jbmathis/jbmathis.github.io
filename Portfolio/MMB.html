          <p class="project-section-title">Summary</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">For three years during college I served on the
            Marketing and Information staff for the Michigan athletic bands, which is a student
            staff that manages the bands' social media and online presences. This included
            managing the online content for the Michigan Marching Band (MMB), which is comprised
            of 12 different instrumental sections. In the Spring of 2017, I pointed out that only
            a few sections had their own website, but even those were extremely outdated.
            The Development Officer for the band entrusted me with overseeing the creation of
            new section websites to use for recruitment. I worked with a student graphic designer
            on the staff throughout the summer and fall of 2017 to design and publish the new
            websites. Though the sites have changed slightly since I helped create them, they are still
            accessible from the MMB's website.</p>

          <p class="project-section-title">Background Information</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">Each of the marching band's 12 sections is comprised
            of people who perform with an instrument or auxiliary equipment, such as drumline,
            twirlers, or trumpets. High School students interested in auditioning for the MMB
            may want to learn more about the particular section they want to join. Before this
            project, this is what displayed when a user clicked the "Sections" tab of the
            MMB website:</p><br>

          alt="The old version of the MMB homepage, which shows a list of all
          the band's sections. Next to the name of each section, only a few have a
          website available for a user to explore.">

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <br><p class="project-section-details">This is concerning because only
            a few of the sections have links to a "Section Homepage". Furthermore,
            the available websites are managed voluntarily by the sections, so
            branding is inconsistent and content could become outdated.
            Websites with outdated information on them are no
            longer useful for prospective students.  A screenshot of one of
            these original homepages is shown below:</p><br>

          <p class="project-section-title">Getting Started</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">First, I asked the band members for
            feedback on what they thought would be useful on a section
            website. After discussing the suggested options with the graphic
            designer, we picked what would be feasible to implement.
            Given the large amount of websites we needed
            to create and the limited amount of time we had, we decided to use Wix
            to create the websites. Wix is a free website-creation tool with
            a relatively small learning curve, but that offers a lot of freedom
            in design and functionality.</p>

        <div class="col-12">
          <p class="project-section-title">Design</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">To make sure the section websites
            had a uniform design, I decided it would be best to create a website
            template that we could then replicate and fill in with each section's
            specific information. I had the graphic designer create three
            templates with different visual designs, which I then presented to
            the band directors to see which format they would like the sites
            to follow. Once we decided on a design and made sure it followed
            all of the MMB's branding requirements, we moved on to creating
            the different sites. </p>

          <p class="project-section-title">Implemented Features</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">Next, I reached out to the student
            leaders of each section to gather photos, quotes, and other
            information to personalize each website. The following features
            were implemented in the websites:</p>

            opportunities of working at a large company. I struggled and made mistakes, but
            the challenges helped me to grow both intellectually and professionally. Seeing how happy my
            redesigned tool made GM employees was the most rewarding part of the experience.</p>
