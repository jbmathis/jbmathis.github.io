          <p class="project-section-title">Summary</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">For three years during college I served on the
            Marketing and Information staff for the Michigan athletic bands, which is a student
            staff that manages the bands' social media and online presences. This included
            managing the online content for the Michigan Marching Band (MMB), which is comprised
            of 12 different instrumental sections. In the Spring of 2017, I pointed out that only
            a few sections had their own website, but even those were extremely outdated.
            The Development Officer for the band entrusted me with overseeing the creation of
            new section websites to use for recruitment. I worked with a student graphic designer
            on the staff throughout the summer and fall of 2017 to design and publish the new
            websites. Though the sites have changed slightly since I helped create them, they are still
            accessible from the MMB's website.</p>

          <p class="project-section-title">Background Information</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">Each of the marching band's 12 sections is comprised
            of people who perform with an instrument or auxiliary equipment, such as drumline,
            twirlers, or trumpets. High School students interested in auditioning for the MMB
            may want to learn more about the particular section they want to join. Before this
            project, this is what displayed when a user clicked the "Sections" tab of the
            MMB website:</p><br>

          <img src="images/Old_Website.png" class="img-fluid"
          alt="The old version of the MMB homepage, which shows a list of all
          the band's sections. Next to the name of each section, only a few have a
          website available for a user to explore.">

      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <br><p class="project-section-details">This is concerning because only
            a few of the sections have links to a "Section Homepage". Furthermore,
            the available websites are managed voluntarily by the section, so
            branding is inconsistent and content could easily become outdated
            if neglected. Websites with outdated information are no
            longer useful for prospective students.  A screenshot of one of
            these original homepages is shown below:</p><br>

          <p class="project-section-title">Getting Started</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">First, I asked the band members for
            feedback on what they thought would be useful on a section
            website. After discussing the suggested options with the graphic
            designer, we picked what would be feasible to implement.
            Given the large amount of websites we needed
            to create and the limited amount of time we had, we decided to use Wix
            to create the websites. Wix is a free website-creation tool with
            a relatively small learning curve, but that offers a lot of freedom
            in design and functionality.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <p class="project-section-title">Design</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">To make sure the section websites
            had a uniform design, I decided it would be best to create a website
            template that we could then replicate and fill in with each section's
            specific information. I had the graphic designer create three
            templates with different visual designs, which I then presented to
            the band directors to see which format they would like the sites
            to follow. Once we decided on a design and made sure it followed
            all of the MMB's branding requirements, we moved on to creating
            the different sites. </p>

          <p class="project-section-title">Implemented Features</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">Next, I reached out to the student
            leaders of each section to gather photos, quotes, and other
            information to personalize each website. The following features
            were implemented in the websites:</p>

          <p class="project-section-details">Instead of publishing all of the
            section websites at once, we decided to publish one per week to
            coordinate with each section's feature on the MMB social media
            accounts. This not only gave us more time during the fall to finish
            the websites, but also made the publication of each site more
            exciting. To achieve this, we created a landing page that linked
            to each of the section websites and displayed what date the site
            would be published if it wasn't yet available. </p><br>

          <p class="project-section-details">Student reception of the websites
            was very positive, mostly due to the improved visual design and
            personalized content. On the other hand, the websites weren't viewed
             very frequently after their initial publication and took substantial effort to
             maintain. Therefore, the Marketing and Information staff simplified
             the design after I graduated. The sites were used during
             recruitment season in the winter though, so the project was regarded as a large
             success.</p>

          <p class="project-section-details">This was a passion project I
            oversaw from ideation to publication. While it was daunting knowing
            the sites would be viewed by thousands, I'm very proud of the result.
            The band directors were so impressed with these section websites,
            they decided to overhaul the MMB website too!
