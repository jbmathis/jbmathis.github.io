          <p class="project-section-title">Summary</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">This was a semester-long group
            project where I worked with three other individuals to research the
            M-Bus app. The M-Bus app is a transportation app that University of
            Michigan students, faculty, and visitors use to
            navigate the university's bus system. Our research uncovered
            several issues with the app, including
            inaccurate bus arrival time estimates, the omission of popular features from previous versions, and
            unresponsiveness. </p>

          <p class="project-section-title">Background Information and Research Questions</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">My group chose to
            research this app because the university had recently rolled out a
            new version; however, many of us had poor experiences with it and
            were curious how other users felt. We also believed the large
            amount of passengers of the university's bus system would benefit
            from our research if we defined weaknesses and suggested improvements.<br><br>
            Therefore, our research questions were "Between the old version and
            the new version, which aspects of the app do users find most
            helpful or frustrating? Do these aspects significantly affect their
            decision to use the new version?" </p>

          <p class="project-section-title">Competitive Analysis</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">First, we started with a
            competitive analysis. We focused on analyzing other transportation mobile
            apps, such as SpartaRide (the bus app used at Michigan State University),
            CATA (Capital Area Transportation App, used for the area near Penn
            State), Easy BART (used for San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit)
            and MAVEN (GM's car renting application).</p>

          <p class="project-section-details">Next, we created a survey to
            understand how user's were interacting with the app. We broke up the
            survey questions into four different sections: user information,
            user goals, task difficulty ratings, and feature value ratings.
            We surveyed a convenience sample of 28 people, most of which were
            students at the university. Here are some of our notable results: </p>

          <p class="project-section-title">Survey Results</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">One of our main findings was,
            given the choice between the two versions of the app, a majority
            preferred the old version. A potential reason for this is the old
            version allowed users to view multiple bus routes (and the live
            location of buses on that route) on the map at a time, since this
            is the main difference between the two versions. On the other hand,
            100% of those surveyed said they use the app to check bus arrival
            times, with only 29% using it to decide which bus to take. This is
            confusing because viewing multiple bus routes is a feature that
            would typically be used when users want to decide which bus to take;
            it is not necessary to look at the map to see bus arrival times. To
            understand why viewing multiple bus routes on the map was so valuable
            to users, we needed to conduct more in-depth research. </p>

            research, however, we created personas based on the information we
            had already gathered. Here is an example of one of the personas we
            created: </p>

          <p class="project-section-title">Interviews</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">Next, each person in our group was
            responsible for interviewing two people, resulting in a total of
            eight interviews. All of the people we
            interviewed were students, but had differing levels of experience
            with the app. Our questions aimed to clarify student usage and
            opinions on the app. Afterwards, we transcribed and coded the
            interviews to extract some of the main themes present among the responses.</p>

          <p class="project-section-title">Interview Findings</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">Our interviews revealed that users
            tended to be primarily frustrated with the responsiveness of the app
            and the inaccuracy of the information. The new version displays a
            "Nearby Stops" screen when you open the app, which uses a user's
            location to display what buses will be arriving near them; however,
            it frequently malfunctions. This is particularly frustrating when
            someone is trying to see when different buses will be arriving,
            which explains why users then go to the map to look at the bus
            locations for themselves. In this situation, viewing multiple
            routes on the map would save time, hence the user frustration with
            the omission of this feature in the new version.</p>

          <p class="project-section-details">We then conducted four usability
            tests: three with students from our class, and one with our professor.
            Each researcher in our group was assigned to either be the
            facilitator, screen recorder, note taker, or timekeeper,
            with the positions rotating for each test. Our findings showed that
            users tended to make errors when deciding which bus would take them
            to their intended destination, specifically
            confusing north-bound buses with south-bound buses and vice versa.
            Our professor also had considerable trouble since she wasn't
            familiar with the bus routes themselves, proving the app to be
            confusing for new users. </p>

          <p class="project-section-title">Final Thoughts</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">Through our semester-long research,
            we uncovered several issues with the newest version of the MBus app,
            such as unresponsiveness, inaccurate information, and added
            features that didn't improve the user experience. As a result of
            these issues, many users expressed frustration, with some choosing
            to avoid using the app altogether. This project not only exposed
            me to different usability research methods, but allowed me to
            analyze an app that was relevant to a large audience. Unfortunately,
            the scope of this project did not include being able to act on these
            usability issues to make improvements. </p>
