          <p class="project-section-title">Summary</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">The purpose of this semester-long project was to design an interface for the inside of
            an autonomous car. It is apparent that the transportation industry is moving towards
            autonomous technology, but the front-facing interface poses novel issues, one of which
            being convincing people to trust this technology to drive for them. With AutoMate, we
            created an interface that features augmented reality and obstacle detection technology
            in an attempt to foster trust between passenger and car.</p>

          <p class="project-section-title">Problem Definition</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">People are wary of riding in autonomous vehicles because it
            requires them to let the car make the decisions. In particular, people do not fully know what
             the car sees or does not see, so people are worried that the car will make a fatal mistake.
             My team and I feel that autonomous technology offers the ability to substantially improve
             safety on the road, so addressing the issue of trust between people and autonomous vehicles
             could lead to wider adoption of autonomous vehicles and ultimately improve road safety.</p>

          <p class="project-section-title">Competitive Analysis</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">To start our project, we researched other autonomous technology
            (some related to the automotive industry and some not). Our goal was to see what other solutions
            chose to display, what functionality was offered, and if people trusted the technology enough
            to use it.</p>

          <p class="project-section-details">From there, everyone in the team individually created 40 sketches
             of possible solutions to our problem statement. Though we wanted to design an interface, we wanted
             to investigate other solutions to see if there were aspects we wanted to incorporate in
             our solution.</p>

             windshield and console screen prototyping. We started with proto.io, but switched to
             using Adobe Illustrator/Invision later in the process. During this process, we created
             the Environmental Awareness Display (EAD) on the center console to give detailed
             feedback about what the car is sensing. We also added feedback about the signs the
             car is registering and how the vehicle will react to upcoming stoplights.</p>

          <p class="project-section-details">We created this design with the goal of inspiring
            trust in people who are apprehensive about riding in autonomous vehicles. While I
            am very proud of the design we ended up with, I wish we had been able to explore
            and prototype voice interactions more. Along with the detailed feedback on on the
            windshield and console, voice interactions could make the interface feel much more
            natural and allow passengers to regain the sense of control they are wary of giving
            up in autonomous vehicles. Nevertheless, our design offers a possible solution to
            some of the novel challenges autonomous vehicle interfaces must address.</p>
