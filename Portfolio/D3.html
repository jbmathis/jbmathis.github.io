          <p class="project-section-details">This was my capstone project for my
            bachelor’s degree in UX design and took place over the course of my
            final semester. Since this was a group project, I collaborated with
            three other students from my class to complete assignments. Our
            project involved researching and redesigning the website for
            <a href="https://datadrivendetroit.org/">Data Driven Detroit (D3)</a>,
            a nonprofit organization aimed at providing high-quality data
            to drive informed decision-making in Detroit. Throughout the
            semester, my team had weekly meetings with D3 employees to discuss
            our findings, requirements, and progress. At the end of the project,
            we presented our final design to D3 and the rest of our class.</p>

          <p class="project-section-details">Our specific task was to redesign
            the Toolbox page of the D3 site, where users could browse and interact
            with the various datasets D3 offers. D3 wanted to ensure the information
            architecture and design was simple so users ranging in
            levels of data experience could easily interact with their resources.
            The D3 team was already developing a prototype for a new website,
            so they asked my group to analyze the prototype along with the current
            site to provide insight on how to improve the user experience.</p>

          <p class="project-section-title">Competitive Analysis</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">Our competitive analysis aimed to
            discover how other sites organized their content by comparing
            attributes such as items included in the header, the use of hero space,
            and structural organization of assets. We evaluated four sites in total.
            Two sites were directly similar to D3 (Western Pennsylvania Regional
            Data Center and Shift Research Lab) and two were indirectly related,
            but used notable methods of organizing content (Netflix and Kaggle).
            This activity helped us to understand different information
            architecture methods used inside and outside the industry.</p>

          <p class="project-section-title">Heuristic Analysis</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">Next, we conducted a heuristic analysis
            of D3’s current site and prototype to evaluate the usability of both
            portals. We followed the usability heuristics from Nielsen Norman Group’s
            10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design. After gathering and
            categorizing the issues, we rated the severity of each issue on a 1 - 5
            scale agreed on ahead of time. Though we recognized that these ratings
            were subjective, we felt the ratings would help us and D3 prioritize
            requirements in the future. You can see a screenshot of part of the analysis below:</p><br>

          <p class="project-section-title">Usability Tests</p>
          <p class="project-section-details">To validate the issues we identified,
            we ran five usability tests. We recruited users based on our three
            target user groups: one user was a professional urban planner,
            two were University of Michigan students with
            data and analytics experience, and two were
            students with no prior data experience. Since our goals and research
            questions were different for each user group, we drafted three different
            test scripts. In each, we asked users to complete tasks with D3’s current
            and prototype site, randomizing which site users tested first. Combined
            with insights from our earlier research, we formulated our key findings, shown below:</p><br>

          <p class="project-section-details">We then created personas for each
            of our three user groups based on our findings. Since our usability
            tests were done with Ann Arbor residents, these have been extrapolated
            to represent Detroit-based users, which we recognized could have
            introduced bias. The data analyst persona is shown below:</p><br>
